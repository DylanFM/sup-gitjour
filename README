'Sup Gitjour?

This is a one-page Merb app which displays the results of running the command "gitjour list". There's the option to have the page updated automatically every 25 seconds.

A few ideas:
- Have a local cloned copy of any repositories so they are available when they are no longer served.
- Add notes to repos... tags? ratings? 
- Search.. maybe like an autocompletion kind-of filter on the repositories shown
- Pull info from repos, like latest commit (how long ago?) etc.
